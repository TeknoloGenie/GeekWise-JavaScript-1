            <div class="point">
                Objects in javascript allow us to store a collection of properties and functions
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                This can be considered useful for a veriety of things, one thing could be to group together functionality,
                another could be to simply store all the data of a user in an object.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                By abstracting your functions to objects it allows our global namespace to not be so cluttered with the
                name of every single function we create. Maybe we only want to access a specific function on a specific
                type of thing.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: just enter "window" in your console and press enter. What do you see? It will vary depending
                    on what site you're on, but the window is our "global" namespace. It holds all the top level
                    properties, functions, and objects that are available to our application.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Objects are essentially a set of <strong>key</strong> / <strong>value</strong> pairs. Imagine it like a variable,
                the variable name is the key in this case, and what your assigning it to is the value.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                The typical way we'll talk about creating objects is with the <code>{...}</code> notation.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                You'll use the curly braces, followed by a property name, a colon, and the property value.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                All key value pairs are separated with a <code>,</code> (comma)
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Lets take a look at a simple object
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var student = {
    firstName: "Joe",
    lastName: "Dirt",
    age: 35,
    "favorite-food": "pizza",
    raiseHand: function raiseHand() {
        alert("the student raises their hand");
    }
};
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Run the above code in your console. What happens? How can we use this thing?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                We can access properties and functions of our objects using the <code>.</code> notation. Lets look at
                out object values.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
console.log(student.firstName);
console.log(student.age);
student.raiseHand();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets pick that code apart. <code>student</code> is telling javascript to look inside of the
                <code>student</code> object, and the <code>.</code> (dot) notation is asking for something, in this case
                it will find a function named <code>raiseHand</code>.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Once the function <code>raiseHand</code> is located it's called like any other function.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Alternatively, we can also use <code>[...]</code> (bracket) notation for accessing our object
                properties.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
student['raiseHand']();
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">
                The above code works in the exact same way as dot notation. Sometimes you MUST use this
                notation, for example, when the key for our js object is not a valid object name. (See the favorite-food
                example)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                You can also access object properties using variables. 
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var prop = "raiseHand";
student[prop]();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                What about if we access an object property that doesn't exist? What result does that yield?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
console.log(student.foo);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Non-existant properties when accessed will return <code>undefined</code>.
            </div>

            <h3>Modifying Objects</h3>

            <div class="point">
                Unlike strings, <strong>objects are mutable</strong> (they can be changed). To change an object we can
                simply use dot or bracket notation along with the assignment operator for the new values.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Modify your object to include some new properties. Make one of your new properties an
                    array that holds a new objects. Each of these new objects should have the same keys.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var student = {
    firstName: "Joe",
    lastName: "Dirt",
    age: 35,
    "favorite-food": "pizza",
    raiseHand: function raiseHand() {
        console.log("the student has raised their hand");
    }
};

//I'll create an array holding my books name and age.
student.books = [
    {name: "Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set", author: "Jon Duckett"},
    {name: "OS X Yosemite: The Missing Manual ", author: "David Pogue"}
];

console.log(student);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice, the new books array will holds a few new objects, representing the students books.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: create a for loop and loop over the objects in your new array, and use the keys to output
                    a string to the console.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0; i < student.books.length; i++) {
    var book = student.books[i];
    console.log("Once " + student.firstName + " was done reading " + book.name + " by " + book.author + " i had a clear perspective of what to do.");
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                You can also add items to an array using the bracket syntax
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        student["school"] = "geekwise";
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now that we can add elements to an object, how do we remove them? That's where the <code>delete</code>
                keyword comes into play.
            </div>


<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        
delete student["favorite-food"];

console.log(student);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Just like any other data type, objects can be passed into functions as arguments.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Move our for loop code from above into a function, and pass the student object into the function for
                    outputing our array's properties.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
      
function bookInfo(person) {
    var books = person.books;
    if (!books) {
        return;
    }

    if (books && books.length) {
        for (var i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
            var book = books[i];
            console.log("Once " + student.firstName + " was done reading " + book.name + " by " + book.author + " i had a clear perspective of what to do.");
        }
    }
}

bookInfo(student);
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3><code>this</code> keyword</h3>

            <div class="point">
                Lets revisit that raiseHand function. We're currently hard coding in our string for our raiseHand function.
                Wouldn't it be nice if our function could use the properties of the object it's in?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The most obvious way to refer to an objects properties is by referencing our object. Lets alter our
                raiseHand function to refer back to the firstName and lastName of our object logging "Joe Dirt has
                raised his hand"
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var student = {
    firstName: "Joe",
    lastName: "Dirt",
    age: 35,
    "favorite-food": "pizza",
    raiseHand: function raiseHand() {
        var message = student.firstName + " " + student.lastName + " has raised his hand";
        console.log(message);
    }
};
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                This makes sense, our function is reaching into an outer scope to find the student object, then looking
                at the firstName and lastName property for building the message string.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                We can however simplify this. For instance, lets say this is a large object, and in many places we are
                referencing the object name (student in this case). Then we decide that "student" isn't an appropriate name
                for this object, so we want to change it. We would have to update all of the places where we are
                referencing that name.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>this</code> keyword solves this issue. Just like the special <code>arguments</code> variable
                we talked about with functions, functions also have a special variable called <code>this</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                So what is <code>this</code>? <code>this</code> is a special keyword that refers to the functions
                <code>context</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                What is a <code>context</code> you might ask? The functions context is essentially just a reference to
                the object that owns that function. In this case, our <code>student</code> object.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets add a new function called "context" so we can investigate this a bit.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var student = {
    firstName: "Joe",
    lastName: "Dirt",
    age: 35,
    "favorite-food": "pizza",
    raiseHand: function raiseHand() {
        var message = student.firstName + " " + student.lastName + " has raised his hand";
        console.log(message);
    },
    context: function context() {
        console.log(this);
    }
};

student.context();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Ok, so now we can see that the <code>this</code> keyword points to the object that the function
                belongs to. That begs the question, what if a function isn't in an object?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function ordinaryFunction() {
    console.log(this);
}

ordinaryFunction();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                What object gets logged when a function doesn't belong to an object?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>window</code> object is our "outer most" object / scope. Any functions created that are not
                inside of another function, or part of an object will automatically be included in the window object.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                So now that we know that the <code>this</code> keyword references the object that the function belongs
                to, we can use that instead of the variable name to access the properties.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Edit the raiseHand function to use the <code>this</code> object for accessing the firstName and
                    lastName properties.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var student = {
    firstName: "Joe",
    lastName: "Dirt",
    age: 35,
    "favorite-food": "pizza",
    raiseHand: function raiseHand() {
        var message = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " has raised his hand";
        console.log(message);
    }
};

student.raiseHand();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Interesting, so this, is just the object that owns the function. What happens if we assign that function
                to a different object?

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Create a new object that has a firstName and a lastName property. Call raiseHand again, what
                    happens?
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var teacher = {
    firstName: "Aaron",
    lastName: "Russell"
};

teacher.raiseHand = student.raiseHand;

teacher.raiseHand();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                This is a great example of <code>context</code> in action. The object that owns the function provides
                the
                <code>context</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                I lied. <code>context</code> isn't always defined by the object that owns the function, you can also
                "fake"
                it, by providing your own context. This is done with the <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>
                functions.
            </div>

            <h3>
                <code>call</code> function
            </h3>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> functions simply exist to enable the overloading of context
                in
                a function call. The only difference between the two is how you pass arguments to the function. Lets
                alter
                our raiseHand function to accept an argument that we'll also raiseHand.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Note how we pass our arguments to the call function, first we provide the fake context, then we provide

student.raiseHand.call({
    firstName: "foo",
    lastName: "bar"
}, "This call and apply stuff is fun!");
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice, even though we called raiseHand on the student object, we <strong>overloaded</strong> the context by
                using
                the call function. In this case, the object we provided became the context.
            </div>

            <h3>
                <code>apply</code> function
            </h3>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>apply</code> function works in a very similar way to the <code>call</code> function, with one
                exception, instead of a comma separated list of arguments, you must provide an array as the second
                argument.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
student.raiseHand.apply({
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
}, ["Apply needs an array as the second argument!"]);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Again, our context was overloaded, so the the <code>this</code> keyword changed to be the first argument
                to the apply function. Our arguments array was then mapped to each argument in the function signature and
                the function was called.

            <div class="point">
                The <code>for / in</code> loop is a nice way of looping over an objects keys.  It looks like this:
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var obj = {
    name: "Joe",
    age: 35
};

for (var key in obj) {
    console.log(key);
    console.log(obj[key]);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                One gotcha here... which we have not got much into the discussion of prototypes, but just imagine a protoyped object has
                a bunch of properties and methods, some we might now want to loop over?  Well, the <code>for / in</code>
                loop will also loop over those properties if they exist in the object.  For this reason, it's good practice
                to add a check to make sure that the <code>key</code> we are working with only exists on the actual object
                and not part of some other prototype.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">

var obj = {
    name: "greg",
    age: 35
};

for (var key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key);
    console.log(obj[key]);
    }
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                This will now ONLY operate on a key that actually exists in the <code>obj</code>.

            <div class="point">
                Before we end todays lesson lets talk a little about a way you can store data, more specifically the formatting
                in which you can store data. There are many types, XML and JSON are the most popular but today i will
                only introduce you to JSON. To start off with, JSON is formatted similar to objects in javascript.
                JSON is not JavaScript specific and is used in many programming languages. Lets take a look at what a JSON Object looks like.
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
{ "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <div class="point">
                Looks almost exactly like a JavaScript object huh? The only real difference between the two is that
                the <code>key</code> portion of the JSON is surrounded in quotes. See in JavaScript these quotes are NOT needed, however
                to keep with the JSON international standards the key must be surrounded in quotation marks. Now lets take a
                look at another type of JSON, called JSON Array
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Jones"}
]
                </code>
            </pre>

                The goal is to create an object, then to manipulate that object, every time the object is manipulated a
                copy of it is put into a JSON Array.

                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Create an object that has some default data, a few properties called 'name' and 'isFriend'. The
                        isFriend key should default to false.</li>
                    <li>
                        Create a function called addFriend that will ask for your friends name, just a simple full name, or single first name is fine.
                        Set the name on the 'friend' object then pushed that object up to the JSON array. However, after setting
                        the new name, add another property to the friend object called 'id' that is incremented every time
                        a new friend is pushed into the array.
                    </li>
                    <li>Create a basic html page with a Add Friend button that triggers the addFriend function. On Wednesday we will
                        learn how to display those friends in your HTML, and start working more with DOM Manipulation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            Simple terms: Create an object called friend, with dummy data (default data) then a button on an page that triggers the 'addFriend' function.
            Inside the addFriend function prompt the user for their name, take that name that you asked for, and assigned it to your friend.name property.
            Then push the modified object up to an array.
