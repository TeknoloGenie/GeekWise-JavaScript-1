            <h3 class="text-center sub">Removing items from an array</h3>
            <div class="point">
                So now we can create Arrays, access array properties, and add items to arrays, how about removing
                items?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Items can be removed one at a time <strong>from the end</strong> of the array, using the <code>pop</code>
                method. NOTE: This modifies the original array
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Create a variable called lastFriend and assign it to <code>friends.pop()</code>. Then log the variable
                and what do you get? What about logging the friends array? Has it changed?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Another handy array function we'll talk about is the <code>slice</code> function.  It works on arrays a little
                differently.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>slice</code> function will make a copy of the specified indexes and return them in a new
                array.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                The <strong>signature</strong> of the slice function looks like:
                <code class="language-javascript">friends.slice(begin, end)</code>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>begin</code> is the starting index, and the <code>end</code> is the index to
                stop at.  NOTE: If the end (param) is not passed it will get everything until the last one.

            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Create an array with 4 strings, then slice the array to return the middle 2 strings.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                One point to remember about the <code>slice</code> functions is that is <strong>does not</strong>
                modify the original array.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                If we did want to modify the original array we would use <code>splice</code>!  The splice function works in a similar way to the slice function,
                however it allows you to modify the original array. So imagine this like a cake, where as we are splicing
                out those pieces of cake and the will never be there again.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <strong>signature</strong> of the splice function looks like:
            </div>
<pre>
	<code class="language-javascript">
strings.splice(begin, deleteCount, [additional, items, to, add]);
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">
                So lets break this apart, the <code>begin</code> param is our starting index, <code>deleteCount</code> is how many items to remove
                from the starting index, and additional items to add are more elements that you want to add to the
                array (comma separated values).

            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Create an array with at least 6 strings in it. And splice the array to where it leaves the
                first 2 strings and the last string and add one leaving a total of 4 items in the array
                (the 3rd item being the new one you added)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                We can do a lot more with array's, just look at all it's available functions

            <h2 class="text-center sub">Control Flow - Looping</h2>
            <div class="point">
                Looping is the act of repeating a block of code based on a given condition. When the conditions
                is no longer truthy, the loop stops.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>for</code> loop, maybe the most common loop we'll use in class.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                With <code>for</code> loops we need to set up 3 things, our starting point, our condition, and our
                incrementer.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                This type of loop is nice because you do not need to manage the incrementer in your normal code
                excecution, because it's built into the loop structure.
            </div>
<pre>
	<code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">
                What if I want a loop to stop early? Or maybe completely end the loop entirely and all remaining loops?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                Javascript provides two ways of controlling the flow of a loop, the <code>continue</code> and <code>
                break</code> keywords.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                <code>continue</code> will immediately reset the loop to the next iteration, and continue on with the
                loop.  It's basically just saying, disregard the rest of this loop and go to the next loop.
            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Create a for loop that will loop 10 times, and skip the 5th and 7th loop.
                All other loops should log the loop number to the console.
            </div>
<pre>
	<code class="language-javascript">

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5 || i === 7) {
        i++;
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">
                The <code>break</code> keyword will, when encountered, immediately stop the loop AND all subsequent
                loops.
            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Create a <code>for</code> loop that will loop ten times, each time logging the current loop number,
                but terminate the loop on the seventh loop.
            </div>
<pre>
	<code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 6) {

            <div class="point">
                So all our work with arrays up to this point has been retrieving array indexes one at a time using
                a numbered bracket notation, for example <code>friends[3]</code>.  This is useful, but what if your application
                requirements were such that you needed to do something to every element in the array?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                A for loop is a perfect mechanism for iterating over each element in an array. Lets think about how we can do this.
                When we write a for loops condition we manually give it an amount of times we want to loop some code.
                What property in an array tells us how many items are in it?

            </div>
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                Try it: Using what we have discussed give it a shot and try to create your first for loop on your own.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Okay, now that i have made you learn how to loop arrays the hard way, time to show you the easy way to do it.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <code>array.forEach(callback, thisArgs)</code> is a javascript method on every array that executes a given callback on every item.
                There are a few downfalls to this, we cannot force the loop to start at a desired index, and we cant <code>continue</code> or <code>break</code> the loop.

                After you have all of the family members names then ask again whats the relationship of that family member
                and age. And reassign their string name in the array to an array formatted like so [name, relation, age].
                In the end you should have an array of arrays of all your families basic info.
