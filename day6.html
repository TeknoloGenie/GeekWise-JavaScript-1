        <h2 class="text-right"><code>prototype</code></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">

        <div class="point">
            First, before we get into prototype, lets talk about why we would need to use it, what problem does it solve?
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Most programming languages provide a "class" system, that allow for grouping together common functionality.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            You can also <code>extend</code> classes to add additional behavior for something more specific.  This is
            known as "inheritance".
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            For instance, lets say you are building a time scheduling app.  You may break down your code into "objects" like,
            Person, Worker, Developer.  In this case, a Developer would be the most specific case, and would inherit
            properties from Worker, and Worker, and Worker inherits properties from Person.

            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    Person
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Age</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Worker
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Company</li>
                        <li>Hours</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developer
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Title</li>
                        <li>Compensation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            In javascript the prototype is how we can accomplish some structure like the above.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Javascript is a "classless" language.  Instead it allows for prototypical inheritance.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            This means that you create a "prototype" of your objects properties and functionality and then make new
            instances of those things.
        </div>

        <h3><code>prototype</code> syntax</h3>

        <div class="point">
            Lets look at an example of a prototype in javascript.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            So this creates a Person function, and adds to it a greet function to it's prototype.  We're letting javascript
            understand what a "Person" is.  We haven't done anything with it yet, just simply defining inside our program
            what is it to be a "Person".
        </div>

        <h3>It's all objects</h3>

        <div class="point">
            Notice how we are adding the greet function, what does that look like?  Looks like object syntax, right?  In
            javascript, everything is an object, including functions.  Each data type, is handled differently by
            javascript, but they are indeed objects.  That's why <code>"foo".length</code> works or
            <code>[1, 2, 3].length</code> works.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            So lets try and call our greet function.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
Person.greet();
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">Odd, maybe we need to call it on our prototype object...</div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
Person.prototype.greet();
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            Progress!  We are able to get a log to the console, but the <code>this.name</code> property is undefined.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            The problem here is that while we've defined what a person object / function is, we've yet to actually
            create a new "instance" of one.
        </div>

        <h3>The <code>new</code> keyword</h3>

        <div class="point">
            One important concept to understand is that functions can be used in two different ways.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            The first way, is by simply calling the function as we have been.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}

var person = Person("greg", 45);
console.log(person);
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            We are simply invoking the function, there will always be a default return value from this function regardless
            of if we store that value or not.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            If no <code>return</code> value exists, then the return value is <code>undefined</code>.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            We can also invoke a function using the <code>new</code> keyword.  Lets look at that.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}

var person = new Person("greg", 35);
console.log(person);
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            More progress!  Now we can see that the <code>person</code> variable we've created is an object, that has a
            <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>greet</code> function.  So what exactly is that new keyword
            doing for us under the hood?

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Creates a new empty object.</li>
                <li>It executes the "constructor" function using the new empty object as the context.</li>
                <li>Returns the "this" from the constructor, which is now equal to the empty object plus whatever properties
                    were added during the run of the constructor function.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            A <strong>constructor</strong> function is simply what we call a function when calling it with the <code>new</code>
            keyword.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            So now, we can probably get at that greet function...
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
person.greet();
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            So lets look at why that works.  First we define the person, and all the things that a person can do via it's
            prototype.  Then we create a new instance of a person.  Visualize this like baking a cake.  The recipe for baking
            a cake is it's prototype, but it's not until you combine the ingredients and bake it that you have an actual
            instance of a cake.  So using the <code>new</code> keyword is how we create that instance.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            So, why use a constructor function with a prototype over, simple objects, or stand alone functions...
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Well, when you create a new instance of something, all the properties are wiped clean and reset on that new
            instance.  So it becomes pretty handy to now reuse this code throughout your application as needed.
        </div>

        <h3>Movie object function revisited</h3>

        <div class="point">
            For our takehome assignment, you wrote a function that took some arguments (title, runningtime, year) and it
            returned a simple object.  Lets refactor that function so that it actually acts as a constructor function
            and we'll add some nice behavior to it's prototype.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Lets start by analyzing how constructor functions work again.  If we look at our Person function, it looks like
            they simply set some properties.  They quite literally "construct" the instance.  So lets set up our movieObjects
            function that way.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function Movie(title, runningTime, year) {
    this.title = title;
    this.runningTime = runningTime;
    this.year = year;
}
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            Notice, constructor functions don't return anything.  That's because the <code>new</code> keyword handles
            that for us.  If you plan on using a function as a constructor, don't return anything.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Another style convention that is widely recognized is that constructor functions use Capitalized names.
            <code>Movie</code> in this case.
        </div>

    <div class="point">
        This is sufficient to create a movie constructor.  Now lets say, that we always want to make sure that the movie
        title name is capitalized.  Lets add a capitalize function to this function prototype that will do just that...
    </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
Movie.prototype.capitalizedTitle = function capitalizedTitle() {
    return this.title[0].toUpperCase() + this.title.slice(1);
};
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            Notice, this function, that's part of <code>Movie</code>'s prototype, also has access to all the properties
            that the constructor created.
        </div>

    <div class="point">
        Finally, lets actually create an instance of a "Movie" object, and use that capitalizedTitle function.
    </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var movie = new Movie("top gun", 100, 1980);
console.log(movie.capitalizedTitle());
    </code>
</pre>

</div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2 class="text-right">Putting it all together</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <div class="point">
                So now we understand that <strong>everything in javascript is an object</strong>.  We understand how we
                can create single objects, and how we can use constructor functions to create new instances of the same
                object.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets practice this a bit.  Create a js program (snippet is fine) that will:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        Start with your movie array of arrays.
                    </li>
                    <li>Convert each array in the movie array into a movie object using a constructor function</li>
                    <li>Add a <code>checkIn</code>, <code>checkOut</code> and <code>status</code> functions to your Movie functions prototype</li>
                    <li>The <code>checkIn</code> function should set the <code>this.checkedIn</code> property to <code>true</code></li>
                    <li>The <code>checkOut</code> function should set the <code>this.checkedIn</code> property to <code>false</code></li>
                    <li>The <code>status</code> function should look to see if that movie is checked in our out, and return a string stating it's status</li>
                    <li>Create a loop that will run 5 times</li>
                    <li>Inside the loop prompt the user for a movie title they would like to checkout / checkin. (remember, you
                        must spell it the same as in your array)
                    </li>
                    <li>Find the movie object with that title and call the the appropriate function.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Create a <code>Bank</code> constructor function</li>
                    <li>The constructor function should have a <code>balance</code> property equal to <code>100</code></li>
                    <li>Add a <code>credit</code> function to Banks prototype that will add to <code>balance</code></li>
                    <li>Add a <code>debit</code> function to the Banks prototype that will subtract from the balance</li>
                    <li>Create an instance of the bank</li>
                    <li>Create a loop that will run three times and prompt the user for a number input</li>
                    <li>Parse the values into numbers</li>
                    <li>Call the <code>bank.credit(num)</code> function and add that amount to your balance</li>
