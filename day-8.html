                        Lets start a new JSFiddle, create a button and be sure to give it an ID.
                        <!--Teacher: Get them started on creating a new JSFiddle-->
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        Now that we have a button we can add a <code>click</code> handler for, lets actually add the listener. We
                        will use the <code>element.addEventListener(event, handler)</code> function where event is a string for a
                        named event, and the handler is a function to call when the event happens. In this way, the
                        function is referred to as a <code>callback</code>.

                        <!--Teacher: Explain what the element is in element.addEventListener, and give a strong example
                                     of what a callback is-->
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">Lets go back to the JSFiddle you created and add a click event listener that will call
                        a function that you create. The function you create should be something simple like
                        logging or alerting something. Also add a debugger statement in the first line of your function</div>

                    <!--Teacher: Once they get their function to run and hit the debugger statement, go over the concepts
                                 of 'this', explain how for events the 'this' is the button element itself. Show them 'this.id'-->

                    <div class="point">
                        Lets make this a little more dynamic. Add an attribute to your button called <code>rel="..."</code>
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        Lets use that new rel attribute as the content of our alert. Since we know that the context of
                        our function is going to be the node itself, we can use all of our node related functions on the
                        this object.

                        <!--Teacher: Explain how when you target an element using the document.querySelector method and
                                     assign it to a variable, you then can access all of that nodes properties and methods.
                                     Imagine the 'this' as that same variable. Plus a little more. (a little more being
                                     the events properties and methods which we will get more into later)-->

                        <!--Teacher: Have ths students go back to the JSFiddle and use their new knowledge of 'this' to
                                     access their 'rel' attribute to alert something.-->

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-9">

                    <div class="point">
                        Forms in HTML are a perfect way to collect information from someone interacting with your webpage.
                        Until now, we've used prompts as a way of collecting data, but prompts are clunky which makes a
                        form a much more attractive alternative.  Form usages vary widely based on the type of
                        information you're collecting, and which form elements you decide to work with.
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        Lets start building something right off the bat. Lets build a form that will wrap a paragraph.
                        Inside the paragraph will be some blank input fields. And when you click submit your input fields
                        will turn into Bold text of the value you typed into the field. Go to
                        <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/5ocdvpdy/1/">this JSFiddle</a> and do the TODO's as we learn about them.
                        And do the ones we have already learned about.
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        Our first three todo's we should be able to handle using <code>document.querySelector()</code>
                        and <code>element.addEventListener()</code> and by creating a function to use for the event handler.
                        It looks like the last todo we can do as well using <code>removeChild()</code>. and the 5th one
                        can be done using <code>document.createElement()</code>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The <code>submit</code> event</h3>

                    <div class="point">
                        So, just like we added a <code>click</code> event to our li tags in the previous exercise, there
                        are other events we can listen for and react to with javascript.  One of these is the <code>submit</code>
                        event of an HTML form. After creating your even handler go ahead and click submit, what happens?
                        Either one your Result area in JSFiddle refreshed. Or two you got this error
                        <code>{"error": "Please use POST request"}</code>.

                        <!--Teacher: The reason this is happening is due to the <code>event</code> being handled by the
                                     browsers default behavior. In order to prevent the browsers default behavior from
                                     refreshing a page after a submit event you need to pass in a parameter to your event
                                     handler lets call it <code>evt</code> and on the first line of code you need to
                                     <code>evt.preventDefault</code>.-->
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        This works like you would probably expect.  We get a reference to our form, add a submit event
                        listener, then write a callback function to handle processing the form.
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        The first thing we need to learn is, without modifying the html provided in the JSFiddle how can
                        we target the input fields. Notice each input field has a name attribute. Lets say our form element
                        was assigned to the variable <code>dogEntryForm</code> that form had some input fields, one of which
                        has the name attribute <code>dogBreed</code>. We could access that input elements node with <code>dogEntryForm.dogBreed</code>.
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        The next thing to do is to create two new elements as said in todo #5.
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        For TODO #6, in order to get the value that you have typed into the text input field you will need to get access
                        to the node elements value property. So for example <code>dogEntryForm.dogBreed.value</code>
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        Now, enter a value in your form field, and click submit.  What happens?  What result did you get?
                        What happened after you dismissed the alert?
                    </div>

                    <div class="point">
                        The last and final thing we need to learn in order to complete this Fiddle is the ability to
                        replace the input elements with a strong element. Javascript provides a simple way to do that
                        using <code>replaceChild(newChild, oldChild)</code>.

                        <!--Teacher: If your having a hard time explaining and painting a picture of how the replaceChild
                                     method works then draw on the board one div. and inside that div put two span elements.
                                     Explain that in order to remove one of those span elements they would need to access
                                     the replaceChild method embeded on the div itself. Refer to the drawing i'll be sending
                                     over to you if you have any problems visualizing that.-->
                    </div>


                    <!--Teacher: If there is time left in the class please allow the students to pick a website of their
                                 choosing. And have them create an event that will listen to every click on the entire page
                                 and hide the element that was clicked on. In order to embed code that you create into any
                                 website you much open up your chrome console and copy and paste the entire event listener and code into the console.-->
