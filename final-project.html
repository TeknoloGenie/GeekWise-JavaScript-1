                    </ul>

                    Be sure to check for edge casing, ie. no numbers in the name fields.

                    When all information is entered and the user is created then the user should be redirected to the login page.
                </div>

                    links for private chatting and messages. The friends list should also have a way of sorting the list
                    by username, status, and any other way you might want to order it.
                    <br>
                    Finally, the list should also have buttons for adding and removing friends. The Remove friend button
                    can be added to each friend’s info.Adding friends should require a first and last name.
                    The fields can be set up how you like, whether that’s always visible or setting the form to display:none;
                    and setting the attributes to display:block; when a button is clicked.

                    messages and a send button to post those messages. The msg should not only take what you put in,
                    but should also add your username to the posted text so everyone knows who sent it. The page will
                    need to check the server every 5 seconds or so to see if any new messages have been added.
