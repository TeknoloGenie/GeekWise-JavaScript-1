            <h2 class="text-center sub">Project Structure</h2>

            <div class="point">
                Before we begin lets outline the project folder structure, you should all have an empty folder created
                called TodoApp. Open up IntelliJ and <code>create a new project from existing source</code>. Open up the
                terminal and initiate your git repo using <code>git init</code>. Go to your GitHub account
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                After you have your project create in IntelliJ and your GitHub repo has been created create the
                following file/folder structure. After your done commit it with the commit message "Initial Commit" and
                push it up. using <code>ctrl</code> + <code>K</code> on windows and <code>cmd</code> + <code>K</code>
                for mac.

                Every project needs a file structure and this is just the most basic one you will use when creating a
                simple Vanilla Javascript Application. The next thing to do is to think about what were building, and
                how to build it. Piece by piece.

            <div class="point">
                The first thing we should always do is think about how what the desired result we want is. Im going to
                give a brief description of what the application should do. Along with some details and specifics about
                each of the features this TodoApp should have. How you accomplish the task is completely up to you,
                there are a million ways to skin a cat, or in a development sense, a million ways to code the same
                thing.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                While developing this Todo app please keep in mind Edge Casing, for example stopping a user from adding
                an empty Todo.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Keep in mind you may use any frontend framework to help you make the UI fancy. Actually its encouraged
                and extra points will be given.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                TodoApp simply allows users to type in any given task and add it to a list of
                things Todo. After a todo task is added a user should be able to edit, delete or complete the task.
            </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <h1 class="text-center sub">User Interface</h1>

            <div class="point">
                When building an application he first thing you always do is built out the user interface. Most
                developers like to draw out on paper or in photoshop some mockup's of what the app might like look in
                order to help them lay out the skeleton design of the HTML.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The user interface for a todo app is relatively simple, we need an input field in order to type what
                Todo in, we need a list to hold our Todo items in and we need a button to actually tell the text in the
                input field to get inserted into the list of items. This design logic however only takes care of adding
                some tasks to a list of items.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                In order to add the functionality to edit, remove or complete a Todo we need to think on a more specific
                level, what are we editing, removing or completing? The Todo item right? Aren't we going to need some
                type of way to call some function for each of these features? So to fine tune our UI requirements we'll
                need a list item with a checkbox inside it, and a few buttons one to edit on to delete.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                At this point your UI requirements are complete and you can start building the Javascript Logic.
            </div>

        </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <h1 class="text-center sub">Javascript Logic</h1>

            <div class="point">
                This is the hard part, its time to use the elements (html) you created to make your Todo app do what it
                needs to do. Hopefully you assigned each of your main elements that your users will interact with some
                ID's so you can target them in your javascript. If not do so now, and lets go over what each UI Element
                that calls a function will do.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Input Field</u>: The input field where the user will type in what they want Todo. This field should
                be cleared when its text is added to the list of things Todo.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Add Todo Button</u>: This is the button that will call our function to add a new Todo to the list.
                The logic behind this function is to dynamically create a new <code>Todo Item</code> list item element
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (List Item)</u>: This is the element that gets created when you click your add todo button.
                It should contain the text of the Todo (text of the input field), a checkbox (for completing) and the
                two buttons to edit and delete the items.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Checkbox)</u>: When a user checks this you should add some kind of class to the list item
                that strikes through the text and makes the text lighter. And dont allow it to be edited. (So hide the
                edit button)
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Edit Button)</u>: Remember when we created that <a
                    href="https://jsfiddle.net/5ocdvpdy/1/">JSFiddle</a> to turn an input field into text? Well were
                doing the same thing here, accept this time were turning the text of the list item into an input field,
                allowing ourselves to edit it then turning it back into plain text when you hit enter.So if you think
                about it, your creating an input element, with an event listener listening for when the user hit the
                enter key. (Do some google'ing).
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <u>Todo Item (Delete Button)</u>: Fairly simple, remove the entire List Item this button is within. How
                can you target the parent element of the button?
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="point">
                First lets remember, this class is not accredited, meaning this grade you get does not mean much on
                academic level. This grade scaling system is strictly meant to give the student a rough idea of how they
                grew and where there at by the end of the class.
