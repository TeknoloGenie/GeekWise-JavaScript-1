            <div class="point">
                Write a js program that will:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Create an array holding the numbers 1 - 500</li>
                    <li>Using the array as the basis for a loop, remove one element per loop (pop), with the result
                        being an empty array.
                    </li>
                    <li>What is the result? Anything surprising happen?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets debug what happened, and see how we could make this work in a way we would expect it too.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                When we talked about <code>for</code> loops we saw that the <code>for</code> loop will evaluate the
                "condition" portion of the loop with every iteration.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                How did this condition cause an unexpected result?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                The answer lies in the <code>length</code> property of the array. If you recall, it's is updated anytime
                the array is manipulated. So with every <code>pop</code> the <code>length</code> would decrement by 1.
                As soon as <code>i</code> variable reached 250 and the array length had been decremented to 250, causing
                the loop to stop running, which left 250 items in our array.
            </div>

            <div class="point">So how do we make this work, so we end up with an empty array?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var a = [];

//create an array holding 500 items
for (var i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {
    a.push(i);
}

//loop over the array, poping one item off the list
//with every iteration. Notice, we are using the length
//of the array for our condition, which is re evaluated on
//every loop.
for (var j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
    a.pop();
}

console.log(a);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So what we really want is a variable that isn't going to keep changing with every loop, right? Check
                out the alternative syntax.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0, len = a.length; i < len; i++) {
    a.pop();
}
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">Notice the comma and the <code>len</code> variable that's being created
                <strong>before</strong> we get to the condition. This means that the variable <code>a.length</code> will
                only be calculated <strong>once</strong>

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Alter your original code using this syntax. What is the result of your array?

            <h2 class="text-center sub">Functions</h2>

            <div class="point">
                We've talked about functions during our first few classes, but up until now we've not really looked at
                what they are, how they work, and most importantly, how we can write our own.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Just like how a variable is defined using <code>var</code>. A function is defined with the <code>function</code>
                keyword, followed by a name ending with parentheses. Function names can contain letters, digits,
                underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). Inside the parentheses of a function are the
                <code>parameters</code>,
                parameters are passed into a function and are used as values that your functions code will need.
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    //code to be executed
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                Functions allow you to perform a series of tasks, and return a value that can be used later.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                A <code>return</code> statement is the final value that the function will return. Most of the time your
                functions will return a value, but there will be times where one function will just simply call another
                function, or some DOM manipulation.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                In order to <code>invoke</code> a function you must use the parentheses after the functions name.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                All javascript datatypes have different functions that work on them. For example:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Arrays have <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Strings have <code>split</code>, <code>charAt</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Objects have <code>hasOwnProperty</code></li>
                </ul>

                These functions are all built into each datatypes, functions that are built into datatypes are known as
                methods.
                Lets take a look at a few.
                <pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
//this string method 'split' turns a string into an array
var companyName = 'Geekwise Academy';
var companyNamePieces = companyName.split(' ');
console.log(companyNamePieces);

//this array method 'join' turns an array into string
companyNamePieces.join(' ');
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    Ok, so we know that javascript has built in functions that perform tasks on certain datatypes, but
                    wouldn't it be nice if we could write our own functions?
                </div>

                <h3>Creating your first function</h3>

                <div class="point">
                    So lets recap, in order to define a function we require four things

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>The <code>function</code> keyword followed by...</li>
                        <li>The name of the function</li>
                        <li>A list of arguments to the functions enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
                        <li>The statements that define the functions enclosed in curly brackets</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Create a function that logs "hello world" to the console.
                    </div>
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello world");
}
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    Lets pick that apart line by line:

                    <ol class="list">
                        <li><code>function helloWorld() {</code> - the <code>function</code> keyword followed by an
                            arbitrary
                            function name. In this case <strong>helloWorld</strong>. The function does not take any
                            arguments
                            so we just have an empty set of parentheses. Then we have an opening curly bracket to start
                            our
                            javascript statements.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>console.log("hello world");</code> - the functions body. In this case, we are simply
                            logging
                            "hello world" to the console.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>}</code> - closing curly brace, ends our function definition</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="point">Great, run that in the console. What happens?</div>

                <div class="point">You call a function by using it's name, followed by a set of parenthesis. If you
                    recall
                    other functions we've used, the functions are always called with the parentheses.
                    <code>console.log(...)</code>
                    <code>alert(...)</code>, etc...
                </div>

                <div class="point">So, lets call our function
                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Place the function in a snippet if you dont already have it in one. Run the snippet then
                        go to the console and type <code>helloWorld()</code>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="point"> So we called the function, and javascript executed the code found inside it. Now you
                    should see your "Hello world" appear in the console.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Now, lets create a function that takes 1 argument, and log that to the console instead of the hard
                    coded "Hello world" string. While were at it lets rename it to something more appropriate, like
                    <code>log</code>.

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Create a function called log that accepts one argument, and logs it to the console.
                    </div>
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function log(stuff) {
    console.log(stuff);
}

log("the fox jumps over the lazy dog");
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    Notice, we do not use the <code>var</code> keyword when working with our function arguments. The
                    arguments
                    are scoped to that function (more on this later).
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Call your <code>log</code> function without passing any arguments, what gets logged to
                        the
                        console?
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="point">Great, now we're getting somewhere, we can define our own functions that accept
                    arguments
                    and do something with them. It's also worth pointing out that functions can also call other
                    functions.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Lets try something a little more complicated, but more useful. It would be really nice if we had a
                    way
                    to capitalize a string, for proper names, etc... Maybe js provides a nice way to do this:

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Lets check and see if js provides a string capitalize function...
                    </div>
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "aaron";
var capped = name.capitalize();

console.log(capped);

>> TypeError: undefined is not a function
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    Lets look a little closer at that error... <code>undefined is not a function</code>. In our example,
                    we are calling two functions, <code>name.capitalize()</code> and <code>console.log()</code>. Which
                    one
                    is likely giving us the problem?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Since we know <code>console.log()</code> is a real function, it's likely that javascript is telling
                    us
                    that <code>name.capitalize</code> is undefined, and thus when we try and call it, it's not a
                    function. But to be sure lets debug our code. Put a breakpoint on the line where <code>capped</code>
                    is defined. Then type in the console name.capitalize, what do you see?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    While js does not provide a way of capitalizing the first letter of a string, it does provide a way
                    to upper case an entire string. It looks like <code>"aaron".toUpperCase()</code>.

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Create a string (variable or directly inline) and use the toUpperCase function on it.
                        What is your result?
                    </div>
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
console.log("aaron".toUpperCase());
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    The result should be an entirely uppercase string. So how can we use this to our advantage if we
                    wanted to write a function that will capitalize just the first letter?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    So we should create a new function, that will take a string value (argument), and return a new
                    value.

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                        Try it: Lets discuss how you might tackle creating a capitalized string using methods we've
                        discussed
                        in the last few classes. Hint: <code>toUpperCase</code>, string indexes, and <code>slice</code>.
                    </div>

                    <div class="sidenote">
                        In javascript <strong>strings</strong> are <strong>not mutable</strong>. This means that when
                        you
                        take any action on a string, you're actually creating a new string. So it's important to realize
                        that
                        since I can't actually change the string "aaron" into "Aaron", we can fake it by creating
                        another
                        string.

            <h2 class="text-center sub">Handling Edge Cases</h2>

            <div class="point">
                When writing functions (or any js program, really), it's very important to consider edge cases. As a
                developer, it's your job to anticipate odd ways your function might be used and make sure it handles
                those cases. What happens if you call your capitalize function on an empty string? How can we fix that?
                What other edge cases might be useful to consider?
            </div>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
//this handles our case when no string is passed in (str is "falsy")
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
        </code>
    </pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice the function now contains two return points, one for the case where we don't have a string, and
                one where we do. It's also important to understand that a function will stop executing any code
                following
                a return statement, so if no string is passed in, nothing past <code>return "";</code> will be executed.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                What about making sure that the argument passed into the function is actually a string?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>typeof</code> operator is helpful here. <code>typeof</code> operator will evaluate the type
                of thing we are working with, and return that value as a string.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Use the <code>typeof</code> keyword to detect the type of thing we're dealing with.
                </div>
            </div>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
typeof 'Aaron'
typeof 3
        </code>
    </pre>

            <div class="point">
                So, how can we use typeof to ensure the argument is a string?
                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: alter your original capitalize function to ensure that a value is passed in, and that it's
                    a string.
                </div>
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str || typeof str !== "string") {
        return str;
    }
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                Edge casing is a sure proof way of preventing bugs in your application. Or even properly notifying a
                user what
                went wrong and why. Always begin thinking about odd ways someone might use your code and anticipate how
                you could handle it!
            </div>

            <h3>The <code>arguments</code> keyword</h3>

            <div class="point">
                This is more of an advanced topic, but worth mentioning here. Inside any javascript function, you will
                have available to use an array like object called <code>arguments</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                I say array like because it looks like an array, but is actually missing many of the functions arrays
                have to work with. However, it does contain a <code>length</code> property.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets take a look at how the <code>arguments</code> variable works.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: lets create a function that will add up all of the arguments we pass into it. In all other
                    cases we've looked at, you must map the arguments being passed into the function, to the function
                    declaration itself, so the <code>arguments</code> variable will actually let us handle an arbitrary
                    number of arguments. This means we don't need to define the arguments in the function
                    <strong>signature</strong>.
                </div>
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
function adder() {
    console.log(arguments);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets finish this function by making it add up all of the arguments we pass into it. Anything non
                numberish
                should be ignored. For instance, if I call <code>adder(1, 2, "foo")</code>, the result should be 3.
            </div>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <h2 class="text-center sub">This, Scope & Context</h2>

            <h3>Scope</h3>

            <div class="point">Every js program runs with a "scope". This can be thought of as the things that are
                currently available to the execution of a program. Or in other words "what functions and variables
                you can see".
                The main / base scope is referred to as the "global" scope. In order to access the current scope we
                use the <code>this</code> keyword. And the word <code>context</code>
                simply means "that objects scope". Remember, everything in JavaScript is an <code>object</code>
            </div>

            <h3>This and Context</h3>

            <div class="point">
                Lets say you wanted to access all the data in the scope, using the <code>this</code> keyword is how
                you would accomplish that.
                And we we refer to the "context" of something, im simply saying the "this" of its scope.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                One important thing to understand is that code <strong>outside</strong> of a function can not access
                any
                code <code>inside</code> the function.
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
function foo() {
    var a = "inside foo";
    return a;
}

console.log(a); //undefined, because "a" is "scoped" to the foo function
console.log(foo()); //should log "inside foo" because the function was called, and a value returned
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                What about visa versa? Can the inside a function access anything outside of the function?
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "aaron";

function capitalize() {
    return name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
}

var capitalizedName = capitalize();
console.log(capitalizedName);
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                Functions do indeed have access to the variables and other functions that exists in outer scopes
                (which,
                when you think about it, is why you can console.log(...) something inside of a function.
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-center sub">More on Functions</h2>

            <div class="point">
                So now we know how to write a function, but there are other ways to do it as well. You'll surely
                encounter them in the wild so it's nice to know what's going on when you see them.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Functions in javascript are "first class". This means they can be passed as arguments to other
                functions, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables (instead of being a named function).
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                When a function is assigned to a variable, it's called a <strong>function expression</strong>.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Create a function expression that assigned a function to a variable.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function (str) {
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                So what is different here. Notice, the function declaration does not have a name. This is what is known
                as an <code>Anonymous function</code>, or a function with no name.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                If it has no name, how do we call it? Same way we do with other functions, but we use the variable name
                instead. In the case of the capitalize function above, we can call it as
                <code>capitalize("aaron")</code>.

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Create and execute a function expression.
                </div>
            </div>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function (str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
                    
                </code>
            </pre>

            <div class="point">
                One thing to note about anonymous functions, they don't actually have to be anonymous. In fact, it's
                good
                practice to name all your functions, for the purposes of error reporting. The function below will work
                just the same.
            </div>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
</code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Now, lets try an experiment. Lets create a new function (not a function expression) called
                <code>logName</code>.
                Then, above that code, lets call <code>logName</code>. What would you expect to happen?
            </div>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">
logName("aaron");

function logName(name) {
    console.log(name);
}
</code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                This is due to something javascipt is doing called <code>hoisting</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Even though javascript executes <strong>linearly</strong>, function definitions are
                actually "hoisted" to the top of the scope. So even though we call logName before we define it,
                javascript is
                actually recognizing the definition of the function, hoisting it to the current scope in which its
                defined in,
                which makes it available to call before the definition in the code actually happens.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Is the same true of function expressions?

                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    Try it: Call a function expression before it's defined. What happens?
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript">
foo("aaron");

var foo = function(name) {
    console.log(name);
}
</code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So what happened there? Why did we get the <code>undefined is not a function</code>?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The reason for this is that <strong>only</strong> named function definitions are hoisted.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets look at this a little closer. What would you expect to happen in the example below?
